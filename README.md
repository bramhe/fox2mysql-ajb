# fox2mysql-ajb 


Hello Reader

This is part of a project where the requirement was to transfer records from FOXPRO to mySQL.

I just uploaded the complete files.....you will need to remove a lot of extra line and customize it by renaming some parts of it.

Keep updated if you want my help.

Thanks
